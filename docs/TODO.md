# TODO / Notes

- KO `common.json`'s `media.enlargeLabel` and `media.lightbox.*` keys are
  not currently rendered in KO — the Gallery/Press grids that use them are
  gated behind `isEn` in `MediaTabs.tsx`. They were added intentionally in
  anticipation of that gate being lifted. Do not delete them as unused.

- Gallery source photo spec: long edge 2000–2400px, JPEG quality 85.
  Given the `images.deviceSizes` step structure in `next.config.ts`,
  sizing originals larger than this brings no real benefit.

- KO pages (Home, About, Performances, Projects, Media) are all currently
  in placeholder state behind their `isEn` gates. Once real KO content is
  ready, these gates need to be lifted together, page by page.
